## Description
This app is an extremely in depth interactive platform analyzing Obesity Rates across the United States.

 - Using code, the statistics are chosen by the user
 - Selection of Ethnicity, Years, and Percentage intervals affect the graphics
 - A density graph of the United states changes colors of states by the     criteria
 - A time-series graph of the top 3 and bottom 3 states changes by specified criteria
 
This analysis is a very eye-opening topic about the health of people in the United States and taking further action is apparent through interacting with ethnicities and years from the data set.
